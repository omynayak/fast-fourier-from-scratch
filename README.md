# Cooley Tukey FFT 

## What is it?
- An implementation of the Cooley Tukey algorithm, building logic from scratch.
- A complete end to end construction, starting with defining a Complex template class and complex numeric operations.
- Uses the Taylor series expansion to compute the twiddle factor (Maclaurin expansion of sine and cosine) and absolute values.

## How do I use it?
- Just clone the repository, use the following command in the terminal, and run the executible.

```bash
g++ main.cpp fft.cpp -o main
```

### Any suggestions are welcome!
